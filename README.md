# The Bank Queue (Poisson) Simulator

### 📘 Project Description
This program simulates a **bank queue** for an 8-hour working day (480 minutes).  
It helps a bank manager analyze whether two tellers are enough to handle customer flow efficiently.

The simulation models random customer arrivals based on the **Poisson distribution concept**, calculates the waiting times, and prints a report showing:
- Average wait time  
- Maximum wait time  
- Standard deviation of wait time
